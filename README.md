# git5
TASK 5

Hello I'm Susmita Das. Iam pursuing BCA from SICSR,Pune.
This is my first digital online course which include the concept of github.

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
 It is designed for coordinating work among programmers,
 but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
 GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
 Git is the preferred version control system of most developers, since it has multiple advantages over the other systems available.
 It stores file changes more efficiently and ensures file integrity better.
